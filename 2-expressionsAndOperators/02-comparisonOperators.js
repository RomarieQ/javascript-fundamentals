// Equality

// equal operator
'3' == 3; // true - they are technically valued the same (== compares value)


// strict equality operator
'3' === 3; // false - the types are compared, and one is a string and one is a number


// opposite operator
// ! named -> BANG or Not or Exclamation point operator, will flip the next conditional (part)
'3' != 3; // false 
'3' !== 3; // true (strictly not equal)


// Greater than
3 > 4; // false


// Less than
3 < 4; // true


// Greater than or equal to
3 >= 4; // true


// Less than or equal to
3 <= 4; // true


// And operator
let x = 13;
x >= 5 && x <= 33; // true -> both have to be true (if left is false then already false and don't have to check the second statement after &&)


// OR operator
let y = 12;
y >= 2 || y == -3; // true -> only one side has to be true (if left is true then you don't have to think about the second statement after ||)

let y = 1;
y <= 8 && y !== 5; // true
